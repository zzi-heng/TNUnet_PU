# TNUnet for Phase Unwrapping(PU)

We introduce a new U-shaped network called TNUnet to achieve phase unwrapping(PU).
TNUnet, a robust phase feature extraction network, is ideal for regression and segmentation models. 
With its symmetrical U-shaped network design, it effectively preserves detailed features across various scales, enhancing PU accuracy.

This network provided here can be used for one-step PU based on regression model.
